# Carousel Web Design
The Carousel Web Design project focuses on designing and implementing a dynamic, interactive carousel (slider) component for modern websites.
A carousel allows multiple pieces of content—such as images, text, or cards—to be displayed within a limited space using smooth transitions. 
This project demonstrates front-end development skills by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web component.
